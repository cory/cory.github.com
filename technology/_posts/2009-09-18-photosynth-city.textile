There is an awesome convergence of photogrammetric techniques -- like this as well as Microsoft's Virtual Earth -- and human edited geometry a la Second Life and Google Earth coming that is going to give us interactive-scale and fully up-to-date models of the whole world.

And wait for that convergence to hit augmented reality.  Living in the future kicks butt.
