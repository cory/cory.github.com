title: Kindle and the Technomob

I am in a particularly pro-Amazon mood today, since they are sending me a replacement for my dead <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015T963C?ie=UTF8&tag=collapsinggeo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0015T963C">Kindle</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=collapsinggeo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0015T963C" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/>. However, wanted to point out this result from Amazon dumb decision to delay releases of Kindle book editions:

"Kindle owners flooding reviews with 1 star ratings":http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/03/amazon-apologizes-to-michael-lewis-over-kindle-flap/

This shouldn't come as too much a surprise. Amazon is snubbing the community of Kindle owners and missing a huge opportunity to increase digital revenues ("as I wrote a couple of months ago":http://ondrejka.net/stupid/2010/01/31/1158-somethoughts-on-amazon.html). Let me buy a Kindle version early at a premium and I will.

Right now I have half-a-dozen Kindle pre-orders queued up. Why not let me get them now for an additional $10? That's free money Amazon, publishers, and authors are just leaving on the table. Dumb.
