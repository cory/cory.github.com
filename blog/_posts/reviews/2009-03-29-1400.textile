My friend "Salman Ahmad":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_Ahmad just wrote to let me know that his memoir, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416597670?ie=UTF8&tag=collapsinggeo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1416597670">Rock & Roll Jihad</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=collapsinggeo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1416597670" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/>, is now available for pre-order from Amazon.  I've been fortunate to read the first few chapters and look forward to reading the full version.  I've known Sal for a few years now and never fail to be amazed by the challenges he faced -- and continues to face -- as a rock star in Pakistan and South Asia.
