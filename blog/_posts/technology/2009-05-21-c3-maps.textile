"Microsoft's Visual Earth":http://www.microsoft.com/virtualearth/ has been doing this for a while, but these new movies from "C3":http://www.c3technologies.com/en_image_tech.php are quite pretty.  Definite style points for all the matrix-camera action, too.  Very impressive for a straight imagery-to-model conversion.  What would be really cool would be to see their engine running in "Unity3D":http://unity3d.com/ or another web platform.
