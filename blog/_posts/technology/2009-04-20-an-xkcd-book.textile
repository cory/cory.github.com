title: an xkcd book!
excerpt: Ok, sorry for two "xkcd":http://xkcd.com posts in a row, but just saw this "story":http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/20/business/media/20link.html. Randall Munroe, the creator of xkcd, is releasing a physical book with 200-ish cartoons in it.  Very cool, as well as an excellent discussion of how digital artifacts can effectively transition into the physical. However, how come 10,000 copies at $19? This is an artifact for us, the fans of xkcd.  Where is the leather bound, vellum coffee table edition for $200?  Want!
