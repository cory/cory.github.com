title: holy crap awesome
excerpt: I know, you're sick of "GitHub love":http://github.com, especially if you aren't a programmer, product manager, or developer of one stripe or another, but I really think these guys are on the right track.  They have opened up their "developer site":http://develop.github.com/ and have all the pieces to make just about any project tool you can imagine.  Thanks, guys!
