I've been lucky enough to know Jane for a few years now and she never ceases to amaze.  Few people bring a broader mix of knowledge and experiences to fun, engagement, and play.  She has a special genius for remixing ideas in ways that make you first go "huh" and then smack yourself in the head and go "duh!"  Thanks for making us all a little smarter, Jane!

Great interview on "Boing Boing Video":http://www.youtube.com/boingboingvideo.
