title: some speaking clips
---
So much of the "public speaking":http://www.washingtonspeakers.com/speakers/speaker.cfm?speakerid=6164 I do is for small CEO and C*O gatherings that very little video exists.  Fortunately, "Washington Speakers":http://www.washingtonspeakers.com/speakers/speaker.cfm?speakerid=6164 kindly shared some clips from a talk in 2008.
