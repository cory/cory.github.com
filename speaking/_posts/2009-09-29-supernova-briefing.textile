---
Thursday morning at 9am PDT I'm on the "Supernova Network Age Briefing":http://supernovahub.com/2009/09/oct-1-supernova-network-age-briefing-with-cory-ondrejka-agility-beyond-coding/. We'll be talking about the reasons for -- and challenges to -- broadly applying agile methodologies to how businesses approach all of product development.  Should be a lot of fun!
