h4. A Ruby project inspired by Thomas Gideon's python "Flashbake":http://wiki.github.com/commandline/flashbake project

h5. What is rubyflashbake?

Automatically checks in files from watched directories to git and github with time, location, weather, and recent twitter comments in the commit comments.

h5. "But, why?" you ask

I thought that Flashbake was a very cool project, but since I spend time in the Ruby world - and do more blogging than writing - converting it to Ruby seemed like a fun weekend project. Plus, I wanted to experiment with monitoring directories, building an app that works well with small Ruby plugins, do some web scraping, automate git, and building a gem.
As always, it's all about writing snippets of fun code.  This gave me an excuse to look at

h5. Use

You can find the project on "Github":http://github.com/cory/rubyflashbake/tree/master.  It is also packaged as a Ruby Gem, so you can download and install it by:

*{border:1px dotted gray}sudo gem install cory-rubyflashbake -s http://gems.github.com/*

Run *{border:1px dotted gray}rubyflashbake --example* in the directory you want to watch to dump the configuration file.  Fill in as needed and then launch *{border:1px dotted gray}rubyflashbake* and enjoy automatic git and github commits with lots of fun location and web aware commit comments.  Bask in joy.
