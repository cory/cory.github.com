title: google not interested in this blog
excerpt: Probably not at all surprising, but my old "blogger blog":http://ondrejka.blogspot.com is indexed many dozens of pages higher than this page.  Obviously, that blog has a year of posts, links, and connections, but I wonder how much bias is inherent to being on blogger.  If you were linking to the old blog, please link to this one.

Probably not at all surprising, but my old "blogger blog":http://ondrejka.blogspot.com is indexed many dozens of pages higher than this page.

As a side note, I'm getting "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master to do excerpts by adding an excerpt variable to the liquid header.  Seems like it might be possible to do this with by indexing through the content and looking for whitespace to break on, but just copying the first paragraph was easier.
