title: Tacos Leprecano
---
A friend was having a taco-themed birthday and asked me to help with the cooking. The week before I had discovered just how easy and delicious homemade corned beef was. "Self," I said, "I think it's time for some fusion!"

WARNING: You are curing meat, which means you're dealing both with potentially deadly pathogens and toxic substances. Double check measurements, keep curing salt -- which is generally dyed pink -- away from children and other seasonings. I like [Putting Food By](http://smile.amazon.com/Putting-Food-Fifth-Ruth-Hertzberg/dp/0452296226/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1431873283&sr=8-1) as a resource on all things curing and canning.

These tacos were amazing. They played. You just need to start 10 days ahead of time.

Step 1, make the corned beef

* 1 whole brisket, about 5 lbs
* 120g kosher salt
* 12g pink curing salt   
* 5 crushed bay leaves
* A lot of pepper

Puncture meat with a fork 20-30 times per side. Combine dry ingredients and rub all over meat. Put meat into a vaccum sealed bag or ziplock with all the air forced out via water immersion. Place in coldest part of fridge for 7-10 days, flipping once per day.

After the cure, pull the meat out and rince off under cold water. Using either sous vide or a very low simmer, cook at 160-170 degrees for 8-10 hours. Remove from heat, immerse in cooled cooking liquid and refridgerate 4 hours or overnight. It will be better if you can let it go overnight.

Step 2, make the spicy slaw the day of

* 1 medium green cabbage
* 1/4 cup sriracha
* 1/4 cup mayonnaise
* 2tbsp course brown mustard
* salt and pepper

Core and thinly slice the cabbage, salt heavily and put in collander for 30 minutes. Rinse salt with cold water and dry in salad spinner. Dress with ingredients, salt and pepper to taste. Cover and refridgerate until needed.

Step 3, make the Sriracha Island sauce

* 1 cup mayonnaise
* 1/2 cup sriracha
* 1/2 onion, diced
* 1/2 cup dill pickles, diced
* 2 hard boiled eggs, diced
* salt and pepper

Mix all the ingredients together. Cover and refridgerate until needed.

Step 4, make the cool topping for the spicy-impaired

* 2 lbs sugar snap peas, ends cleaned up
* 8oz queso fresco
* salt, pepper, juice from 2 limes, and olive oil

Slice the snap peas into 1/8"" strips on the bias. Crumble the queso. Toss together with salt, pepper and olive oil. Cover and refridgerate until needed, then toss with a bunch of lime juice.

Step 5, wake up the corned beef, grill the tortillas.

Corned beef likes to be steamed or simmered just before serving. Cut thin slices across the grain and build the tacos.
