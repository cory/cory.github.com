title: Fried Chicken Doughnuts
---
Apparently, Glazed Doughnut Bistro in Los Angeles makes a Fried Chicken Doughnut. But the only time I could swing by was at 7am and they weren't open. What kind of doughnut place isn't open at 7am?! (Answer: a doughnut shop that's trying to make a name for itself in West Hollywood!)

So I decided to make them. First, I made the fried chicken from the [Fried Chicken and Waffles](/food/2014/02/11/fried-chicken.html "Fried Chicken") recipe, except I cut the thighs into quarters. Then I modified the doughnuts from the [Maple-glazed, Apple Bacon Doughnuts](/food/2010/11/27/0812-doughnuts.html "Doughnuts") recipe (essentially, ditch the apples and juice, add a bit more milk.) The results played out very well.

And a line of them ready to go.

It all worked. The fried chicken stayed crispy, the doughnuts fluffy. In the future, I think the chicken needs to be in even smaller chunks -- probably each thigh into 6-8 pieces and go for a larger, thicker doughnut than normal so that it's possible to stuff the doughnut rather than crimping too doughnuts together.
