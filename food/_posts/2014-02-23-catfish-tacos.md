This is a go-to party recipe, but wanted it today so I made it. Lost of steps, but all pretty easy.

The fish...
> 4 (or more) fresh, farm-raised Catfish filets (one per two people or so)

The drying mix (same as [Fried Chicken and Waffles](/food/2014/02/11/fried-chicken.html "Fried Chicken") recipe )...
> 1 cup corn starch  
> 4 tablespoons kosher salt  
> 2 teaspoons baking powder  

Cut the catfish filets in half lengthwise through the seam in the muscle, then cut each half into two or three pieces. Toss them in the drying mix and set aside.

The wet coat...  
> 1 cup cornstarch  
> 1 cup all purpose flour  
> 1 teaspoon baking powder  
> 2 tablespoons kosher salt  
> 1 tablespoon Penzeys Northwoods Fire (blend of coarse flake salt, paprika, chipotle pepper, black pepper, cayenne pepper, thyme, rosemary and garlic)  
> 1 1/4 cups vodka  
> 1 cup water

Whisk the dry ingredients together fully, then stir in water and vokda. Should be very liquid, barely forming ribbons off of whisk.

The dry coat...

> 2 cups all purpose flour  
> 1 cup pulverized corn flakes (1 cup of corn meal works as a replacement)  
> 2 teaspoons baking powder  
> 1 tablespoon black pepper  
> 1 tablespoon kosher salt  
> 1 tablespoon Penzeys Northwoods Fire

Whisk dry ingredients together.

Heat peanut oil to 350 degrees. Working in batches, dip pieces in wet coat, shake off excess and dredge in dry coat, shaking off excess. Carefully place in oil and dry for 3-4 minutes, adjusting flame to keep oil close to 350 degrees. Remove with spider to drying rack.

The pickled peppers...

> 4-6 jalapeno peppers  
> 4-6 carrots, sweet bell peppers, radishes  
> 1 1/2 cups of vinegar  
> 1 cup of water  
> 4 tablespoons of sugar  
> 2 tablespoons of kosher salt  

Bring water, vingar, salt and sugar to a boil. Cut peppers etc. Toss peppers into liquid, boil for 1 minute, kill the heat. Put peppers into Bell jars and cover with liquid. Ready to eat in 3 hours or store in fridge once cooled.

The slaw...

> 1 head of cabbage  
> Good quality mustard and mayonnaise  
> Kosher salt and pepper  

Peal off any dried or damaged outer leaves, then split in half and remove the core. Thinly slice changing your angle regularly to get a mix of sizes and textures. Toss the cabbage with salt and pepper, adding mustard and mayo approximately 1:1 until just coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours.

The tortillas...

> Masa Harina  
> Hot water  
> Kosher salt  

Mix masa per package directions. Make tortillas on griddle. If you have a gas stove, finish directly over burner just before eating.

Assemble tacos, give a shot of lime juice to brighten up just before diving in. Tasty goodness.
