title: Fried Chicken and Waffles (v1)
---
This is a blend of Korean BBQ wing and classic southern techniques. They rule.

The chicken...
> 10 chicken thighs with their skin on, bones removed (the butcher should do this for you)

The drying mix...
> 1 cup corn starch  
> 4 tablespoons kosher salt  
> 2 teaspoons baking powder  

Cut thighs in half along the gap between muscles so you have 20 pieces. Put mix in a large ziplock bag, shake around to mix, then toss thighs 4 at a time to coat. Shake off excess mix and put them on a drying rack for at least 30 minutes or overnight in refrigerator. This step dries out the surface for a crisper fry.

The wet coat...  
> 1 cup cornstarch  
> 1 cup all purpose flour  
> 1 teaspoon baking powder  
> 2 tablespoons kosher salt  
> 1 tablespoon Penzeys Northwoods Fire (blend of coarse flake salt, paprika, chipotle pepper, black pepper, cayenne pepper, thyme, rosemary and garlic)  
> 1 1/4 cups vodka  
> 1 cup water

Whisk the dry ingredients together fully, then stir in water and vokda. Should be very liquid, barely forming ribbons off of whisk.

The dry coat...

> 2 cups all purpose flour  
> 1 cup pulverized corn flakes (1 cup of corn meal works as a replacement)  
> 2 teaspoons baking powder  
> 1 tablespoon black pepper  
> 1 tablespoon kosher salt  
> 1 tablespoon Penzeys Northwoods Fire

Whisk dry ingredients together.

Heat peanut oil to 350 degrees. Working in batches, dip thighs in wet coat, shake off excess and dredge in dry coat, shaking off excess. Carefully place in oil and dry for 8 minutes, adjusting flame to keep oil close to 350 degrees. Remove with spider to drying rack. Hope your fellow cook has kept up with the waffles.    

The waffles...

The dry team...

> 2 teaspoons baking powder  
> 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour  
> 1 teaspoon baking soda  
> 1 teaspoon cinnamon  
> Pinch kosher salt

Mix the dry team together. Make a well in the center.

The wet team...

> 1 cup half nâ€™ half  
> 1 cup sour cream  
> 2 eggs, separated  
> 3 tablespoons butter, melted  
> 1 teaspoon vanilla

Mix the egg yolks and rest of the wet team together. Add to the dry team, and fold together until combined but not completely smooth. Whip the egg whites until barely stiff peaks, then fold the whites into the rest of the batter.

Follow directions on your waffle iron to make the waffles.

Finally, the sauce...

> 2 parts Grade B maple syrup  
> 1 part Sriracha sauce

Mix the syrup and Sriracha sauce together. Place chicken on a waffle and drizzle sauce on top.
