excerpt: Today "O'Reilly":http://toc.oreilly.com/2009/04/over-160-oreilly-books-now-in-kindle-store-without-drm-more-on-the-way.html announced that over 160 books were coming to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154JDAI?ie=UTF8&tag=collapsinggeo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00154JDAI">Kindle</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=collapsinggeo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00154JDAI" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/>.  I've been using Amazon's PDF conversion service but programming books often ended up mangled, so this is good news as the O'Reilly blog posts mentions improved table rendering.  A quick glance seems to support this.  Hopefully we'll see many more technical books converted in the coming months.
