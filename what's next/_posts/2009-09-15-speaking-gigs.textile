title: speaking gigs
---
Sitting at SFO, about to fly to Miami via Charlotte in order to give a speech on technology, product development, and transformation to a small group of senior executives. Although I gave "talks":/speaking,html for EMI, I haven't built an original keynote in a while, so this has been an enjoyable exercise.

The client, to their credit, actually pushed hard to get an outline early, which kept procrastination to lower levels than I am used to. The themes that are emerging tie technological innovation, corporate transformation, and disruption together through community engagement and agile processes, so this should be a lot of fun.  Since it is only a 25 person audience, the talk will be very interactive and allow for extensive discussions.

In particular, I look forward to kicking around who executives feel are the first to know when innovation has changed the market they operate in -- employees? customers? partners? competitors? -- and who within the organization is responsible for making sure that group is found and listened to.

Deciding whether or not to take speaking gigs was a difficult call, since I have enough interesting projects to mull over and being home has been so nice.  However, with the economy beginning to recover and a regular flow of speaking requests starting up, I find that it is an efficient way to broaden my network and lets me produce (reasonably) coherent thoughts on diverse topics.

Need to get back to the talk.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154JDAI?ie=UTF8&tag=collapsinggeo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00154JDAI">Kindle</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=collapsinggeo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00154JDAI" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/> is telling me that Dan Brown's new novel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385504225?ie=UTF8&tag=collapsinggeo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0385504225">The Lost Symbol</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=collapsinggeo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0385504225" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/> has just downloaded, so need to finish talk before I can crack the book.

Or, more correctly, turn on Kindle and hit next page button. "Cracking the book" is much more evocative, but I am glad that I'm carrying bits not atoms.
