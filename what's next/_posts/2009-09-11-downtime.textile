title: down time

Now that I've completed my departure from EMI, there is an almost overwhelming urge to dive into whatever's next RIGHT NOW. I haven't actively been looking for something new since 1998, so it is surprisingly difficult not to take one of the options already available. Especially in the current economic climate, it is a little scary to say "no, thank you" to some very interesting opportunities.

But that is what I'm going to do. I've decided to spend at least 2 months of down time. Well, maybe "down time" is an exaggeration. Between speaking gigs, reading, studying, ideas that need fleshing out, and fun coding projects, I have plenty to keep to me busy and off the street, but none of them are really what's next. At least, I don't think so, but that's what down time is about.

I'm also tying to get as plugged back in to interesting projects and ideas as possible, so if there's something I should look at, please ping me!
