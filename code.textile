h1. "Mockup to html conversion routines":http://github.com/cory/mockup/

h2. What it is

A set of routines built around the file mockup.rb.

Usage: mockup [ options ]
    -p, --pasteboard                 Use pasteboard rather than file
    -n, --name [basename]            Basename for files created by exporter
    -s, --source [filename]          File to use rather than pasteboard
    -h, --help                       You're looking at it

Allows you to convert from Balsamiq Mockup's XML file to HTML, css, and Javascript.

h2. "But, why?" you ask

I needed something fun to do as a general learning project for Ruby, BDD, rspec, autotest, etc.  I think Mockups is awesome, so though parsing the XML files would be a good exercise.  Plus, I can imagine some cases where being able to go straight to HTML would make Mockups even more useful.

This is unlikely to be worked on again, but was fun to write.
