When we built the some of the first buildings in Second Life for Demo 2002, one of the great discoveries was how easy it was to create geometry if you had the images there in-world with you.  Google goes one better by making it trivially easy to add simple building geometry to Google Earth date via Google Building Maker. It says a lot about Google's organizational strengths, weaknesses, and priorities that they can create this but have difficulty seeing/capturing the value of virtual worlds.
